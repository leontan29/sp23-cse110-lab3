              Michael Johnson presented the financial reports for the
              first quarter of 2023, including the income statement,
              balance sheet, and cash flow statement.  Board members
              reviewed and discussed the financial reports, noting the
              positive revenue growth and the need for cost management
              in certain areas.

	    <h4>Strategic Planning Discussion</h4>

              process for the upcoming fiscal year, highlighting key
              goals and initiatives.  Board members provided feedback
              and suggestions on the proposed strategic plan,
              including the need to prioritize customer retention and
              expansion efforts.
	    </p>
	    <p>
              After thorough discussion, the board agreed to further
              refine the strategic plan and present it for approval at

              John Smith informed the board that two board member
              positions will be vacant due to term expirations and
              called for nominations for new appointments.  Several
              board members nominated candidates and discussed their
              qualifications.

              A motion was made by Susan Wong to appoint the nominated
              candidates as new board members, which was seconded by

              business items presented. No motions or decisions were
